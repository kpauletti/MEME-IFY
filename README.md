# Meme-ify
## Meme maker / Photo album

Memeify is a Ruby on Rails web app for uploading photos and adding text onto those photos.

The memeify web app uses:
 
 * RMagick gem for image manipulation
 * BCrypt for user signup/login
 * Carrierwave for image uploading
 * Bootstrap/Sass for styling
 
 This was our first app, built for our friends and family project, brought to you by myself, Adi Nelson, and Stephani Oliveira
